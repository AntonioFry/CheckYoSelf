# CheckYoSelf

CheckYoSelf is a website that allow you to make custom checklists. As you add more, they will get displayed on the right side of the page where they can stack. Evenmore the checklists are able to persist through pageload and won't be lost if you refresh the page. Because there can be multiple checklists, it is possible for you to filter them out using a search bar.

## Comp

As a part of the project, it was important to make sure that the site also appealing. Using a comp, I worked to make sure that my site replicated the same style (comps below).
